# Autogenerated swap sizes are as follows:
#    - *suspend*: Swap is always at least total memory size,
#      and up to 4GiB RAM follows the rule-of-thumb 2 * memory;
#      from 4GiB to 8 GiB it stays steady at 8GiB, and over 8 GiB memory
#      swap is the size of main memory.
#    - *small*: Follows the rules above, but Swap is at
#      most 8GiB, and no more than 10% of available disk.
# In both cases, a fudge factor (usually 10% extra) is applied so that there
# is some space for administrative overhead (e.g. 8 GiB swap will allocate
# 8.8GiB on disk in the end).
#
# If *file* is enabled here, make sure to have the *fstab* module
# as well (later in the exec phase) so that the swap file is
# actually created.
userSwapChoices:
    - none      # Create no swap, use no swap

# This optional setting specifies the name of the swap partition (see

# If nothing is specified, the partition name is left unset.
